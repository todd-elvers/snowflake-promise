# fp-snowflake-promise

The goal of this library is to provide a more pure, class-less wrapper around the [Snowflake SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowflake-sdk) 
with improved support for SQL named parameters.

This library is heavily inspired by [snowflake-promise](https://github.com/natesilva/snowflake-promise).  While this library is currently
a fork of the aforementioned repository it diverges enough in functionality that I will likely rename it once the logic is a bit more
flushed out and tested.
